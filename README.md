# ðŸ”® Customer Churn Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a customer will **churn (leave)** or **stay** with a company, based on key features like tenure, age, income, education level, and more.

Itâ€™s a beginner-friendly machine learning model with real-world applications like subscription-based services, telecoms, SaaS products, etc.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Loads customer data (like tenure, age, income, etc.)
- Trains a Logistic Regression model
- Predicts if a customer is likely to churn or not
- Shows **probabilities** of churning using `.predict_proba()`
- Visualizes which features impact the prediction using model coefficients
